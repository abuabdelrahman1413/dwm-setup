![Made for Debian](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20for-Debian-A81D33?style=for-the-badge&logo=debian&logoColor=white)

A minimal suckless DWM setup for Debian-based systems, personalized for my workflow.
Following the suckless philosophy with carefully selected patches â€” simple, efficient, and hackable.

## ðŸ“œ Suckless Philosophy

This setup adheres to the [suckless philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/):
- **Simplicity** - Minimal code, maximum functionality
- **Clarity** - Configuration through clean C header files and shell scripts
- **Hackability** - Easy to understand, modify, and extend

All configuration is done by editing `config.h` files and recompiling â€” no bloated config systems.

## ðŸš€ Installation

This installer is designed to be run on a fresh Debian installation. It sets up the entire desktop environment, including drivers, applications, and links the configuration files from this repository.

### Quick Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abuabdelrahman1413/dwm-setup.git
cd dwm-setup
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

**Note:** The script is interactive and will prompt for optional software like NVIDIA drivers, Flatpak, and Obsidian.

### What Gets Installed

The installer is comprehensive and sets up a complete, minimal desktop:

1.  **System Setup** - Updates packages, sets up the Sid repository with APT pinning for specific apps.
2.  **Core Packages** - Essential X11, build tools (`build-essential`, `libx11-dev`), and dependencies.
3.  **NVIDIA Drivers** - (Optional) Installs proprietary NVIDIA drivers with a choice of auto-detection or direct installation.
4.  **Suckless Tools** - Compiles and installs `dwm`, `slstatus`, and `st` from the source in this repository.
5.  **Dotfile Management** - Creates symbolic links from this repository to `~/.config/`, so any change is immediately reflected in your source files.
6.  **Shell & Fonts** - Installs `fish` as the default shell and fetches required Nerd Fonts (`FiraCode`, `JetBrainsMono`).
7.  **Optional Software** - Prompts to install:
    -   **Flatpak** with Flathub and **Joplin**.
    -   **Obsidian** note-taking app.

## ðŸ“‚ Configuration Files

This setup is managed entirely through symbolic links. The `install.sh` script links the directories from the `suckless/` subdirectory of this repository into your `~/.config/` folder. This means any edit you make in `~/.config/` is an edit on your source files, ready to be pushed to Git.
